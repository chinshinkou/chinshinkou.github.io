Stereo matching is one of the most important task of stereo binocular vision system. This paper will discuss stereo matching method used in tsunami warning system which measures tsunami based on stereo binocular vision system. To solve the problem of lacking obvious feature points in sea surface image, the paper extracts sea waves out from sea surface image to form feature points and integrates sea waves' size, shape, brightness, location and lengths in four orientations to distinguish each point and finishes stereo matching of tsunami warning system by the feature points and their features.
