<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<div class="about-intro" markdown="1">

I received my Ph.D. degree of Engineering from [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/), Japan, in 2024. From 2024 to 2026, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Chubu University](https://www.chubu.ac.jp/), working with Prof. Fujiyoshi (Chubu University) and Dr. Ushiku (OMRON SINIC X) on a [JST Moonshot R&D project](https://www.jst.go.jp/moonshot/program/goal3/36_ushiku.html).

My research interests lie in deep learning, natural language processing, and behavior change support systems.
